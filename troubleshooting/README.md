 ## Assignment: Linux Permissions

### Objective:
Understanding and managing file and directory permissions in a Linux environment.

### Instructions:

1. **Create Users:**
   - Create three user accounts named `user1`, `user2`, and `user3`.

2. **Create Directories:**
   - Create a directory named `assignment`.
   - Inside the `assignment` directory, create two subdirectories named `docs` and `scripts`.

3. **Assign Permissions:**
   - Set the following permissions on the directories and files:
     - The owner should have read, write, and execute permissions.
     - The group should have read and execute permissions.
     - Others should have no permissions.

4. **File Operations:**
   - Inside the `docs` directory, create a file named `report.txt`.
   - Inside the `scripts` directory, create a shell script named `generate_report.sh`.

5. **Adjust Permissions:**
   - Adjust the permissions on the `report.txt` file to allow the owner to read and write, the group to read, and others to have no permissions.
   - Adjust the permissions on the `generate_report.sh` script to allow the owner to read, write, and execute, the group to read and execute, and others to have no permissions.

6. **Switch User and Verify:**
   - Switch to each user (`user1`, `user2`, and `user3`) and try to perform the following actions:
     - List the contents of the `assignment` directory.
     - Read the contents of `report.txt`.
     - Execute the `generate_report.sh` script.
